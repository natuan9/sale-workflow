This module provides a more integrated way to classify partners using
Odooâ€™s native **utm.source** model, as opposed to introducing a custom
classification model. The **utm.source** field (``source_id``) is added
to the **res.partner** form, allowing businesses to track the source of
partners, such as marketing campaigns, referrals, or other sources.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo already provides the ability to track the origin of leads or
customers through Source (``utm.source``). This module allows for better
classification and tracking of marketing campaigns and the sources from
which customers are acquired.
